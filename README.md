# matrix-client-wishlist
Wishlist for my WIP Matrix client

- Sliding sync (and other Matrix 2.0 features)
- Actions in bulk for every room in a space
- Friends (not part of the Matrix spec so would be specific to this client)
- Spaces
- User CSS/JavaScript

Because it will be partially hosted on a web server, we can add (some) stuff that isn't actually part of the Matrix spec.
See https://git.speedie.site/speedie/libleet for progress.
